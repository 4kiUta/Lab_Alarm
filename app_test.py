# age_ani = st.number_input("What's animal Age")

# animal = Animal(type_ani, name_ani,age_ani, name)
# animal_df = animal.fram_creation()


### WHAT IS happening in this moment is that the info about animals is passed
### to a dataframe the moment the happ is run
### this is the default values
### type,name,age,owner
### Dog,,0.0,

### --> no name because is an text input so the thing that we got is like an empty string
### --> the same for the owner 
### --> the default value we got for the anumal type (radio button is the Dog) 
### because is the one preselected 



### Check about form and pass all this info inside a form streamlit object
### in order to just run the creation/ append of new data into a df
### the moment the form is completed and submitted.
